## How to update playwright

By keeping the Playwright version up to date we will be able to use new features and test our app on the latest browser versions and catch failures before the latest browser version is released to the public.

```sh
# Update playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
```

See what version of Playwright we have by running the following command:

```sh
npx playwright --version
```
